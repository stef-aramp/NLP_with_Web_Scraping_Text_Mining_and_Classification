# NLP_with_Web_Scraping_Text_Mining_and_Classification
Hey there, this is an all brand new project. I spent a period of time searching, reading some papers, watching some tutorials and finally coding. I will let the project to speak itself, but I have to do a summary. What this project includes and what skills acquired to accomplish it ? 
- Web Scraping, 
- Text Mining, 
- Text Summarization, 
- Cleaning, 
- Pipeline to classify, 
- Name Entity Recognition (NER) and 
- WordCloud

tools: spaCy, Sci-kit Learn, Beautiful Soup, Regular Expressions,pandas, numpy, matplotlib with WordCloud.

BASIC IDEA : We will scrape urls from two web pages. From these pages we will focus on "sports" and "technology" sections. We will gather and store article's urls and the next step is to pull the texts out. So, all we got is sports & tech articles and we will build a predictive model, to classify unknown texts either in sports or tech labels.
